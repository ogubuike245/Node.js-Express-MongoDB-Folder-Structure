# Node.js-Express-MongoDB-Folder-Structure

This repository contains a folder structure for building a back-end application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The structure is designed to promote organization, maintainability, and scalability.

## Folder Structure

example of the structure in practice :

- node_modules/
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- README.md
- src/

  - config/
    - database.js
    - keys.js
    - middleware.js
  - controllers/
    - userController.js
    - postController.js
  - middleware/
    - auth.js
    - errorHandler.js
  - models/
    - userModel.js
    - postModel.js
  - services/
    - userService.js
    - postService.js
  - routes/
    - userRoutes.js
    - postRoutes.js
  - utils/
    - utilities.js
  - app.js
  - server.js

- `ROUTES/`: Contains routes for the application, including the URL paths and HTTP methods that clients can use to interact with the server.

- `SERVICES/`: Contains modules and functions that are responsible for specific business logic or external service interactions.

- `UTILS/`: Contains utility functions that can be used across the application.

- `app.js`: Sets up the Express.js application.
