# Node.js-Express-MongoDB-Folder-Structure

This repository contains a folder structure for building a back-end application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The structure is designed to promote organization, maintainability, and scalability.

## Folder Structure

example of the structure in practice :

- node_modules/
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- README.md
- src/

  - config/
    - database.js
    - keys.js
    - middleware.js
  - controllers/
    - userController.js
    - postController.js
  - middleware/
    - auth.js
    - errorHandler.js
  - models/
    - userModel.js
    - postModel.js
  - services/
    - userService.js
    - postService.js
  - routes/
    - userRoutes.js
    - postRoutes.js
  - utils/
    - utilities.js
  - app.js
  - server.js

  ***

- `CONFIG/`: Contains configuration files for the application, such as settings for connecting to the database or configuring third-party services.

- `CONTROLLERS/`: Contains controllers for handling incoming requests, including logic for processing data, interacting with the database, and generating responses.

- `MIDDLEWARE/`: Contains middleware functions for handling authentication, error handling, and other common tasks.

- `MODELS/`: Contains Mongoose models for interacting with the MongoDB database.

- `ROUTES/`: Contains routes for the application, including the URL paths and HTTP methods that clients can use to interact with the server.

- `SERVICES/`: Contains modules and functions that are responsible for specific business logic or external service interactions.

- `UTILS/`: Contains utility functions that can be used across the application.

- `app.js`: Sets up the Express.js application.

- `server.js`: Starts the server.

- `node_modules/`: Contains all Node.js modules and packages installed via NPM.

- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Contain metadata and dependencies for the project.

The folder structure we have been discussing is an example of a `modular design pattern`.

`Modular design patterns` involve organizing code into modules that can be easily maintained, tested, and reused. Each module handles a specific feature or functionality of the application, and can be developed and tested independently of other modules. This approach allows for better scalability and maintainability of the application.

In our example, the folder structure is organized into modules based on functionality, such as controllers, middleware,services, models, and routes. Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently of the others. This makes it easier to make changes or updates to specific parts of the application without affecting the entire system.
